# Chaotic Circuit

The purpose of this project is to simulate and observe the behaviour of a chaotic jerk circuit which can be modeled as a third order differential equation with a nonlinear term D(x). This project was made to analyse experimental data from time series voltage measurments and compare it to numerical simulations of the ODE.
